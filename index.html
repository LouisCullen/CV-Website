										<div class="item" id="honestmanchester0">Honest Manchester was a site created for university students in Manchester to submit anonymous confessions about their experiences. Intended to give a more anonymous alternative to social media confession pages, the idea was to require a confession from the user to enter the site and view others. This would ensure a consistent flow of content.</div>
										<div class="item" id="honestmanchester1">This project was unique for me as it was undertaken as a method of learning new technologies which I had not experienced before. Because of this, the whole project took an experimental approach and was not intended to be particularly polished or display best practices. Instead, the goal was to have a working site which would teach me some techniques as it was created.</div>
										<div class="item" id="honestmanchester2">The site was built on a stack of MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS, extending my JavaScript abilities beyond what I had experienced before. The familiar frontend styling gave me an opportunity to implement better practices such as less inline styles and less reliance on Bootstrap. Meanwhile, my new exposure to a full stack got me more comfortable working with backend logic.</div>
