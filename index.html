		var hustlio = ["Hustl.io was a team project completed in my first year of university. Throughout the year we visualised, designed and produced a fantasy trading website with real stock market data and inter-user functionality. My main tasks were front-end development and implementation of the inter-user friend system.","This project was beneficial for me as it was my first experience of working as a team on a programming project. It taught me how important communication was, with our use of discord calls and regular meetings keeping the project on track, as well as the importance of being open about lack of knowledge and learning from other developers.","The technologies used were Python, Django, CSS and HTML. I also encountered Docker, SQLite and Postgres DB during development, though these were more the focus of other members of the team."]
		var asteroid = ["Asteroid Belt was a solo project focused on game development. On top of the retro styling being difficult to get right, the challenges surrounding implementation stretched my logical ability and forced me to find workarounds where there was no native solution.","Creating the game was enjoyable as it gave me a creative freedom which I hadn't experienced much before. The prompt gave some requirements for game features, but the vagueness of the rest allowed me to manage my own time and create a product fully from my own vision.","The single programming language used was Python with its Tkinter library, which was a given requirement. Tkinter isn't designed for game development like the Pygame library is, so it forced me to find workarounds for implementation, such as my own collision detection and entity tracking."]

Creating this website has challenged me to discover new techniques to make a professional-looking website, while still giving me a platform to show my preferred styling and personality and show off new techniques I pick up.","The main difference between this project and those I've done before is the lack of external motivation. As it is not being created for anyone else, all motivation must come from myself and any delays only impact my online profile. It has also challenged me to choose when to roll out new versions in order to avoid a messy site going live.","Created with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap, the website hosted as a static website on AWS through their S3 storage system. With the DNS also handled by AWS' Route 53, I have had to research different methods of hosting websites with cloud computing to find what worked for me, giving me further knowledge outside any courses I have done."]

					<h4>Cloud Architecture DevOps</h4>
					<p>
						My experience mainly comes from shadow work with Cossy Cosmas of Diebold Nixdorf. I worked with Cossy across a six moth period, followed by occasional meetings which continue to the present. During these sessions, we discuss not only the skills which are required to convert university education to industrial applications, but also his responsibilities in the company and how they utilise cloud computing to their advantage. The focuses include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understanding the significant financial, operational and environmental benefits of cloud computing.</li>
						<li>Reconciling my theoretical understanding of AWS Cloud technologies with direct exposure to a fully operational PCI DSS transaction processing service.</li>
						<li>Exploring the pros and cons of a strict DevOps deployment methodology.</li>
						<li>Developing a deeper understanding of DevOps concepts such as Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management using Terraform and Puppet applications.</li>
						<li>Learning coding concepts such as code branching, peer review, merging to master and deployment using GIT based code management tools.</li>
						<li>Gaining an insight in to best-practice automation tools such as Jenkins and techniques such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.</li>
						<li>Discussing emerging cloud technologies such as serverless computing and what benefits they bring to large organisations.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						From these meetings, I have developed a greater understanding of how theoretical concepts, some of which I have covered in university modules, can be applied to a functioning company and be conveyed to less technical teams. The process of converting concepts to presentations to features is undoubtedly an important part of the development cycle, which I now have a greater understanding of in an industrial setting.

				<div class="col-12">
					<p>Having worked as part of many teams, from sports clubs to supermarkets, I thrive when collaborating with others. While sometimes I like to be left to work on a task without interruption, I also appreciate the benefits of sharing ideas in a group to produce the best results possible. I am happy to step up to lead in positions where I'm comfortable with the project's aim, but I'm equally happy to follow others' lead when I have less experience.</p>
					<p>Aside from computer science, my main interests are music and sports. With the fantastic Manchester music scene on my doorstep, I often spend weekends out at concerts or shows with friends whenever possible. If football or Formula 1 are on, you can find me in front of the TV at home or out at a bar letting my competitive side show. I love social situations and like to spend as much time as possible with friends, whether that's doing work or relaxing.</p>
